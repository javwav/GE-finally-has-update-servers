## Graphics Enhancement 2.1
- "Force 2D Motion Blur" now works in cyberspace as well (thanks to angryzor)
- Fixed rain enhancements applying when custom atmospheres are enabled (those have their own)
- Made "decrease grass fade out distance" start slightly further away and finish way further to make big patches of grass less annoying
- Decreased reflection artifacts slightly
- Slightly tweaked shadowmap cascade layout
- Removed the NeedleFxSceneData library from all the code files and added it in a separate file to decrease file size and hopefully improve stability

## Graphics Enhancement 2.0
- Big ass update
