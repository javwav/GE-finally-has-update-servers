## jav.wav's Improved Camera 1.7
- Overall better experience !!!
- Removed Dynamic FOV (will be back trust)
- Now the in-game camera sliders work, FOV (camera angle) is 35 at minimum and 55 at maximum
- Made the camera increase FOV to 55 independently from the camera angle setting
- The camera distance will change automatically when the camera angle is edited. You will have to boost to see this
- Made the combat camera slightly closer
- Made the normal camera slightly lower
- Reverted boost FOV to 60 since that was giving collision problems
- Will probably release on gamebanana
